### Notes for "Lets Go Further"

## 3 - Sending JSON responses
- ```func Marshal(v any) ([]byte, error)``` -> pass native Go object and returns JSON representation in []byte
- ```json.Encoder``` -> JSON is created and written to the http.ResponseWriter in a single step, which means thereâ€™s no opportunity to set HTTP response headers conditionally
- All struct attributes in Movie are exported (pubic), so that they are visible to encoding/json
- Struct tag directives
  - ```omitempty``` directive hides a field in the JSON output if and only if the struct field value is empty
  - ```-``` never show particular field in JSON
  - ```string``` converts to JSON string (only works for int*, uint*, float* or bool)
